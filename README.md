## Graceful Degradation and Service Workers Connection
In graceful degradation one of the core concepts is that if a component fails the website can still function because you work from the max technology down to the lower levels with "grace." As for the implementation of service workers, even if an aspect such as the internet connection is missing or extremely slow, the service workers can still retrieve the data stored from previous calls and still send data to the web application and prevent a need from having to directly request and fetch data all the time.
